# Mario-Game
This is a simple clone of the classic Super Mario Bros. game created using JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API. The game features a basic Mario character, platforms, and gravity, allowing Mario to jump and navigate through the level.

The project demonstrates core game development concepts, including:
Sprite rendering and movement, Platform collision detection, Gravity simulation and jumping mechanics, Basic game loop and rendering with the requestAnimationFrame method

Features
Mario Character: A basic Mario character that can jump and fall due to gravity.
Platforms: Static platforms that Mario can jump on, with collision detection.
Game Loop: A smooth game loop that renders the game elements and updates the character's movement.

How to Play
